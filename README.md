## What is this?

**This is a library which provides easy and advanced timers for module developers.**

This project is inspired by [mk's timer library](https://atelier801.com/topic?f=6&t=875052), so make sure to support that also :heart:

***Background***

Since normal players - who aren't module members are not allowed to use tfm module apis timers (`system.newTimer` and `system.removeTimer`) I decided to create a brand new and an advanced timer system for all!

***There are many capabilities for these timers***

- Create timers
- Reset timers
- Kill timers
- Loop timers
- Execute functions after/before mature
- And more!


## How to use?

In order to use this library you need to insert this libraries code in top of your code.

## Examples

#### Creating new timer

```lua
--insert the library code here

tfm.exec.newGame(0) -- You need to load a new map to use this appropriately

local timer1 = Timer("timer1", function() end, 5000, false) -- Creating a very basic timer with a timeout value of 5000

function eventLoop(tc, tr)
  Timer.run(tc) -- You need to call this method inside eventLoop to start and process timers
end


```

### Creating timers with callbacks

```lua

--a function to greet a user
function greet(name, nice)
    print("Hello" .. name .. "It seems you are " .. (nice and "nice" or "not nice"))
end

-- storing the timer in a variable is optional. Storing will be useful if you need to access information about the timer

Timer("callback", greet, 2000, false, "Seniru", true) --setting the callback to our greet function and pass "Seniru" and true as arguments

function eventLoop(tc, tr)
    Timer.run(tc)
end

--Run this code to see the results!

```

### Looping timers

```lua

Timer("looping", function() print("prints") end, 3000, true)
-- This would print `prints` every 3 seconds. Note that you need to specify the time in milliseconds

```


*That's it! You can read more in the documentation*
